# PHPAxieSchool

PHPAxieSchool is a PHP script that aims to help managers and scholars in their Axie Infinity journey

*The script and its developer are NOT affiliated with Axie Infinity*

## Features

At the end of each day, the script gather data on Axie and Coingecko API servers, then build and send an email report to the manager and his scholars.
Each report contain :

- The MMR 
- The SLP earned for the day (the SLP amount should be right even if a claimed occurred)
- Average SLP and MMR
- SLP for today before/after the share
- In-game SLP before/after the share
- Expected for 30 days SLP before/after the share
- The SLP price 

You can define different currencies for the manager and for each of the scholars. (usd, php ...)

## Installation

- Edit config.php
- Send the files and folders to your server
- Make sure /data/ and /logs/ are recursively writable by the script
- (optionnal) Put .htaccess and .htpasswd
- Set a cron to run at 0:00 UTC precisely every day (you can use this https://console.cron-job.org/)

## Give a try

Run index.php from the browser, this will fetch the latest data on prices and scholars (at first time run only).
The HTML manager report will then be displayed.

> Note: First day will not show the SLP !!! (it needs 2 days to be calculated)

Also feel free to check inside the logs folder, everything is logged.
